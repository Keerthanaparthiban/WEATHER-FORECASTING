# Weather Forecastng Using Python

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Weather forecasts are made by collecting as much data as possible about the current state of the atmosphere (particularly the temperature, humidity and wind) and using understanding of atmospheric processes (through meteorology) to determine how the atmosphere evolves in the future. 

This project is used to demonstrate the working of a Weather App in Python using Tkinter module. This GUI app will tell us the current weather of a particular city along with temperature details along with other details. The data's have been fetched from Open weather map https://openweathermap.org/ it helps us to access current weather data for any location on Earth including over 200,000 cities! 

# Modules used :

Tkinter: It is a built-in python library for making GUI using tkinter toolkit.

Requests: It is a library which helps in fetching the data with the help of URL.
